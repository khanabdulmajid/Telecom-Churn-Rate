## Overview
This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company. It uses machine learning models to identify customers likely to churn, helping businesses implement retention strategies.

## Features
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Preprocessing of categorical and numerical features.
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE.
- Model building and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographic and service details, such as:
- `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `tenure`
- `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, etc.
Target column: **`Churn`** (Yes/No)

## Notebooks
1. **EDA.ipynb**: Insights and visualizations.
2. **Modeling.ipynb**: Building and evaluating machine learning models.
